CS61A
=====

HW for the class CS61A at UC Berkeley as seen http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su14
Self teaching through the work.

I am not using the solutions.

I have made the following decisions.

I will attempt to only use the syntax taught up to that point in the course.

I will prioritize first completing the course work.

I will prioritize second attempting to write the 'best' read fastest and most elegant code I can.
