CS61A
=====

HW for the class CS61A at UC Berkeley as seen http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su14
Self teaching through the work.

I am not using the solutions.

I have made the following decisions.

I will attempt to only use the syntax taught up to that point in the course.

I will prioritize first completing the course work.

I will prioritize second attempting to write the 'best' read fastest and most elegant code I can.

I will assume this code is only of interest to me. Hence, I will use naming conventions that may look less readable, but are to me natural. This is not to be interpreted as laziness or obfuscatory naming, simply a well intentioned decision to write code in the manner I would write it if it were only ever seen by myself.
