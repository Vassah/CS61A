CS61A
=====

HW for the class CS61A at UC Berkeley as seen http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su14
Self teaching through the work.

I am not using the solutions.

I have made the following decisions.

I will attempt to only use the syntax taught up to that point in the course, doing my best to translate that restriction between languages. E.g. languages with higher level list support will not use that list support when implementing cons lists etc.

I will prioritize first completing the course work.

I will prioritize second attempting to write the 'best' read fastest and most elegant code I can.

I will assume this code is only of interest to me. Hence, I will use naming conventions that may look less readable, but are to me natural. This is not to be interpreted as laziness or obfuscatory naming, simply a well intentioned decision to write code in the manner I would write it if it were only ever seen by myself.

As time goes on, I will be completing these in other languages, as well, simply as a way to build competency in those languages.
At the moment there is only the original Python material and some Erlang. In the future I hope to write in Haskell, OCaml, Clojure, Go, Erlang and Swift.

This seems like kind of a fun way to go about familiarizing myself with other languages.
